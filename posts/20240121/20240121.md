# Reality Check

> Take the blinders off.

In today's issue, we explore how market participants are often deceived by themselves and others.

## True

> If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.

- William Blake, *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell*

Success in markets largely depends on the ability to see things as they are, not as you wish them to be.

The market has its own reality. For example, Apple closed at $188.63 on the day of writing. To buy or sell Apple shares, it has to be done near this price. Asking for $200 a share will not find takers when the market bid is cheaper. Bidding $160 a share will not attract sellers when the market ask is dearer.

As market participants, we must operate within the market's constraints. The market, for lack of a more potent term, is our master. If we cannot submit to the rules of the game, we will be punished. This means losing money, a painful prospect! In markets, it is far better to be careful, observant, and planning than it is to be quick, scattered, and adventurous. As we gain intuition and experience for markets, we will be more able to capture opportunity when it beckons.

Seeing things clearly is challenging, but we can start by cataloging our preconceptions.

## Bias

> Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.

- Matthew 7:5, New King James Version

Countless biases exist, do you believe you are unscathed?

The ugly truth is that we are all biased. Unchecked bias can be the difference between fortune, mediocrity, and ruin for investors. Your beliefs and actions in the world, but check them at the door when trading markets. The market does not care what your political and religious beliefs are. The market does not care if you are hungry or upset. The market does not care if you "need the money." The market is doing its best to take your money! It is a zero-sum game. When you win, someone else loses, and vice versa.

Examine the following common biases and note which ones afflict your thinking. While I strive to keep my writing human, AI helped generate this list.

- Information processing
  - Anchoring: Relying too much on initial information.
  - Apophenia: Seeing patterns where none exist.
  - Availability heuristic: Judging based on what's easy to remember.
  - Bandwagon effect: Adopting popular beliefs regardless of personal opinion.
  - Confirmation bias: Focusing on things that align with existing beliefs.
  - Framing effect: Deciding based on how information is presented.
  - Hindsight bias: Thinking you knew something would happen all along.
- Self-awareness
  - Egocentric bias: Believing the world revolves around you.
  - False consensus effect: Overestimating others' agreement with you.
  - Illusion of control: Believing you have more influence than you do.
  - Overconfidence effect: Thinking you are better than you are.
  - Planning fallacy: Underestimating how long things take.
- Decision making
  - Escalation of commitment: Sticking with a bad decision due to time/money invested.
  - Gambler's fallacy: Believing past luck affects future events.
  - Loss aversion: Hating to lose more than loving to win.
  - Prospect theory: Making choices based on potential emotions, not just logic.
  - Status quo bias: Preferring things to stay the same.
- Others
  - Dunning-Kruger effect: Unskilled people overestimate their ability, experts underestimate.
  - Impostor syndrome: Doubting your skills and fearing exposure as a fraud.

## Buffalo Jump

[BUFFALO JUMP HERE]

- Alfred Jacob Miller, *Hunting Buffalo*

The bandwagon effect is rampant in markets. Most people are comfortable being part of the "herd" in finance. Confirmation bias is also rampant. People see the world as they like. In markets, participants develop theories about the economy, its direction, and its impact on the market. Some of these theories become popular. Consider all the groveling we have endured for the past year and a half about a recession! Meanwhile, the market moved based on *actions*, not *beliefs*.

[GRAPH HERE]

The graph above shows the S&P 500 E-mini futures (ES1!) and its associated positioning data at the bottom. Positioning data is from the weekly Commitments of Traders (COT) report by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Jason Shapiro is a good source for more on this technique. I like to balance my positioning indicator as follows:

$$
{\text{Manager Longs} \over \text{Manager Shorts}}
\times
{\text{Dealer Shorts} \over \text{Dealer Longs}}
$$

To laymen, asset managers may seem sophisticated, but they're often as biased as their clients. We can call them "dumb money." Dealers and commercials, termed "smart money," often use automated processes for decision making. They are not *always* on the right side of a trade, but they are *more frequently* on the right side of a trade.

The bandwagon effect is partly driven by confirmation bias. As the bear thesis played out and seemed accurate, more people shorted the market. A few profited, and then everyone wanted to do the same. The ES1! index declined -24.5% from December 2021 to October 2022. During the same period, our positioning indicator declined by -93.8%! Being bearish was popular, similar to bearish positioning back in June 2020, September 2015, and October 2011, all bad times to be short the market.

Eventually, the herd is always slaughtered. Whether a gang of bulls or a sleuth of bears, avoid being in either! The current market buzzword is "soft landing," believed by the majority of economists according to the National Association for Business Economics (NABE). Pay close attention to this narrative, it may be as wrong as early calls for a "recession."

## Deceivers Galore

> All warfare is based on deception.

- Sun Tzu, The Art of War

Trading is not a team sport.

Your broker is not your friend, neither is Jim Cramer, and especially not some random guy on Twitter. Assume most information in finance is incorrect or misleading. Some might call this cynical, but when it comes to your money, trust must be earned. If we want to be hermetic about it, retrieve price quotes from the NYSE or Nasdaq, fundamental reports from the EDGAR, and news releases from PR Newswire. This may be too acetic, but it covers all the bases and minimizes incorrect information.

Every entity deserves skepticism, many have blatant vested interests. Here is a short list of companies that deserve your scrutiny (AI assisted).

- Sell-Side Firms
  - Investment Banks: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup
  - Brokerage Firms: Merrill Lynch, Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, E*TRADE, Fidelity
  - Market Makers: Citadel Securities, Virtu Financial, Jane Street, Susquehanna International Group
- Sell-Side Finance Media
  - News Publications: Markets Media, TheDeal, Institutional Investor
  - Research Providers: Bloomberg Terminal, FactSet, S&P Global Market Intelligence, Morningstar, Moody's Analytics
  - Conferences & Events: SALT Hedge Fund Conference, Milken Institute Global Forum, CFA Institute Annual Conference, RiskMinds
- Other Financial Media Companies
  - Traditional: Bloomberg, Reuters, The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, Barron's
  - Cable News: CNBC, Fox Business, Bloomberg Television, CNN Business
  - Digital: MarketWatch, Seeking Alpha, The Motley Fool, Investopedia, Zacks Investment Research
  - Fintech Startups: The Information, Axios, Cheddar, Robinhood Snacks

Despite widespread bias, you have to put trust in something, but please do your homework before investing. For instance, I use Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch for quick looks, but I have found inaccuracies in their data, so I check EDGAR before trading. I also use Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, and Vanguard to manage my accounts, but I have found my broker feeding me false spread data to shake me out of my trade. Why else would the bid on an option with an open interest of five update by the second? Why does it lower once I put in my ask? Why indeed.

Your portfolio manager wants you to "win" after they take their fee! Your broker wants you to "win" after they take their spread! Jim Cramer wants you to "win" after he uses your bid as exit liquidity! When it comes to markets, the mindset is "do for self." It may be arrogant, but it will save you money.

Not wanting to end on too bleak a note, consider that by accepting the ugly truths of finance (a topic *much* deeper than explored here), you can more realistically approach the task at hand. Your task is to extract profit from the market, like any other participant. If your preconceptions or others' deceptions affect your performance, step back, find the bias, and do your best to keep it in check.
