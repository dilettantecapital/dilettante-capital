## The Truth

> If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.

- William Blake, *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell*

Being successful in markets is, to a large extent, due to the ability to see things for what they are, not for what you wish they were.

The market has its own reality. As a simple example, Apple closed at $188.63 on the day of writing. If I wanted to buy or sell shares of Apple, I would have to do it near this price. I could ask for $200 a share, but who will pay me when the market bid is cheaper? I could bid for $160 a share, but who will sell to me when the market ask is dearer?

As market participants, we have to operate within the constraints of the market. The market, for lack of a more concise term, is your master. If you cannot submit to the rules of the game, you will be punished. This means losing money, a painful prospect! In markets, it is far better to be careful, observant, and planning than it is to be quick, scattered, and adventurous. As you gain intuition and experience for markets, you will be more suited to capture opportunity when it beckons.

Seeing things clearly is not easy, but cataloging your preconceptions is a good place to start.

## Bias

> Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.

- Matthew 7:5, New King James Version

There are countless biases, do you believe yourself unscathed?

The ugly truth is that we are all biased. To the investor, unchecked bias can be the difference between fortune, mediocrity, and ruin. What you believe and how you act in the world is important, but check it at the door when trading markets. The market does not care what your political and religious believes are. The market does not care if you are hungry or upset at the time. The market does not care if you "need the money." If anything, the market is doing its best to take your money! It is a zero sum game. When you lose, someone else wins. When you win, someone else loses.

Take a look at the following common biases and note which ones have afflicted your thinking in the past. While I strive to keep my writing human, artificial intelligence helped generate this list.

- Information processing
  - Anchoring: Relying too much on the first information you get.
  - Apophenia: Seeing patterns where there aren't any.
  - Availability heuristic: Judging things based on what's easiest to remember.
  - Bandwagon effect: Adopting beliefs or behaviors perceived as popular, regardless of personal opinion (Herd mentality).
  - Confirmation bias: Paying attention to things that agree with what you already think.
  - Framing effect: Making decisions based on how information is presented.
  - Hindsight bias: Thinking you knew something was going to happen all along.
- Self-awareness
  - Egocentric bias: Thinking the world revolves around you.
  - False consensus effect: Overestimating how much others agree with you.
  - Illusion of control: Believing you have more influence than you actually do.
  - Overconfidence effect: Thinking you're better at things than you really are.
  - Planning fallacy: Underestimating how long things will take.
- Decision making
  - Escalation of commitment: Sticking with a bad decision because of time/money invested.
  - Gambler's fallacy: Thinking past luck affects future events.
  - Loss aversion: Hating to lose more than loving to win.
  - Prospect theory: Making choices based on potential emotions, not just logic.
  - Status quo bias: Preferring things to stay the same.
- Others
  - Dunning-Kruger effect: Unskilled people overestimate their ability, experts underestimate.
  - Impostor syndrome: Doubting your skills and fearing exposure as a fraud.

## Buffalo Jump

[BUFFALO JUMP HERE]

- Alfred Jacob Miller, *Hunting Buffalo*

Confirmation bias is rampant in markets. People see the world how they like to. The bandwagon effect is also rampant. Many are comfortable being part of a crowd. Within markets, participants develop theories on the state of the economy, where it is headed, and what it means for their respective market. Some of these theories become quite popular. Think about all the groveling we have heard for the past year and a half over whether or not we are going to have a recession! All the while, the market moved not based on their *beliefs* but based on their *actions*.

[GRAPH HERE]

The graph above shows the S&P 500 E-mini futures (ES1!) and its associated positioning data on the bottom. I like to balance my positioning indicator as follows:

$$
{\text{Manager Longs} \over \text{Manager Shorts}}
\times
{\text{Dealer Shorts} \over \text{Dealer Longs}}
$$

To laymen, asset managers may be seen as sophisticated market participants. The ugly truth is that they are often just as biased as their clients. We can call them "dumb money" for our purposes. Dealers and commercials are called "smart money" because they typically use automated processes for their decision making. They are not *always* on the right side of a trade, but they are more frequently on the right side of a trade.

The bandwagon effect is, in part, driven by confirmation bias. As the bear thesis played out and seemed accurate, more people shorted the market. A few people short the market, make a profit, and then everybody wants to do the same. The ES1! index declined -24.5% from December 2021 to October 2022. During the same period, our positioning indicator declined by -93.8%! Being bearish was very popular. This is similar to bearish positioning back in June 2020, September 2015, and October 2011, all of which were bad times to be short the market.

Eventually, the herd is slaughtered. A gang of bulls or a sleuth of bears, you should avoid being in either! When I think of the current buzzwords in the market, I think "soft landing" is a popular one. It is one that the majority of economists believe in, as per the National Association for Business Economics. Pay attention to the "soft landing" narrative carefully, I think it will turn out to be just as wrong as the early calls for "recession."
