# Reality Check

> Take the blinders off.

In today's issue, we take a look at how market participants are often deceived by themselves and others.

## True

> If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.

- William Blake, *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell*

Being successful in markets is, to a large extent, due to the ability to see things for what they are, not for what you wish they were.

The market has its own reality. As a simple example, Apple closed at $188.63 on the day of writing. If I wanted to buy or sell shares of Apple, I would have to do it near this price. I could ask for $200 a share, but who will pay me when the market bid is cheaper? I could bid for $160 a share, but who will sell to me when the market ask is dearer?

As market participants, we have to operate within the constraints of the market. The market, for lack of a more concise term, is your master. If you cannot submit to the rules of the game, you will be punished. This means losing money, a painful prospect! In markets, it is far better to be careful, observant, and planning than it is to be quick, scattered, and adventurous. As you gain intuition and experience for markets, you will be more suited to capture opportunity when it beckons.

Seeing things clearly is not easy, but cataloging your preconceptions is a good place to start.

## Bias

> Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.

- Matthew 7:5, New King James Version

There are countless biases, do you believe yourself unscathed?

The ugly truth is that we are all biased. To the investor, unchecked bias can be the difference between fortune, mediocrity, and ruin. What you believe and how you act in the world is important, but check it at the door when trading markets. The market does not care what your political and religious believes are. The market does not care if you are hungry or upset at the time. The market does not care if you "need the money." If anything, the market is doing its best to take your money! It is a zero sum game. When you lose, someone else wins. When you win, someone else loses.

Take a look at the following common biases and note which ones have afflicted your thinking in the past. While I strive to keep my writing human, artificial intelligence helped generate this list.

- Information processing
  - Anchoring: Relying too much on the first information you get.
  - Apophenia: Seeing patterns where there aren't any.
  - Availability heuristic: Judging things based on what's easiest to remember.
  - Bandwagon effect: Adopting beliefs or behaviors perceived as popular, regardless of personal opinion (Herd mentality).
  - Confirmation bias: Paying attention to things that agree with what you already think.
  - Framing effect: Making decisions based on how information is presented.
  - Hindsight bias: Thinking you knew something was going to happen all along.
- Self-awareness
  - Egocentric bias: Thinking the world revolves around you.
  - False consensus effect: Overestimating how much others agree with you.
  - Illusion of control: Believing you have more influence than you actually do.
  - Overconfidence effect: Thinking you're better at things than you really are.
  - Planning fallacy: Underestimating how long things will take.
- Decision making
  - Escalation of commitment: Sticking with a bad decision because of time/money invested.
  - Gambler's fallacy: Thinking past luck affects future events.
  - Loss aversion: Hating to lose more than loving to win.
  - Prospect theory: Making choices based on potential emotions, not just logic.
  - Status quo bias: Preferring things to stay the same.
- Others
  - Dunning-Kruger effect: Unskilled people overestimate their ability, experts underestimate.
  - Impostor syndrome: Doubting your skills and fearing exposure as a fraud.

## Buffalo Jump

[BUFFALO JUMP HERE]

- Alfred Jacob Miller, *Hunting Buffalo*

The bandwagon effect runs rampant in markets. Most people are comfortable being part of a crowd, also called the "herd" in finance. Confirmation bias is also rampant. People see the world how they like to. Within markets, participants develop theories on the state of the economy, where it is headed, and what it means for the market they trade. Some of these theories become quite popular. Think about all the groveling we have heard for the past year and a half over whether or not we are going to have a recession! All the while, the market moved not based on their *beliefs* but based on their *actions*.

[GRAPH HERE]

The graph above shows the S&P 500 E-mini futures (ES1!) and its associated positioning data on the bottom. Positioning data comes from the weekly Commitments of Traders (COT) report published by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). If you want to know more about this technique, Jason Shapiro is a good source. I like to balance my positioning indicator as follows:

$$
{\text{Manager Longs} \over \text{Manager Shorts}}
\times
{\text{Dealer Shorts} \over \text{Dealer Longs}}
$$

To laymen, asset managers may be seen as sophisticated market participants. The ugly truth is that they are often just as biased as their clients. We can call them "dumb money" for our purposes. Dealers and commercials are called "smart money" because they typically use automated processes for their decision making. They are not *always* on the right side of a trade, but they are more frequently on the right side of a trade.

The bandwagon effect is, in part, driven by confirmation bias. As the bear thesis played out and seemed accurate, more people shorted the market. A few people short the market, make a profit, and then everybody wants to do the same. The ES1! index declined -24.5% from December 2021 to October 2022. During the same period, our positioning indicator declined by -93.8%! Being bearish was very popular. This is similar to bearish positioning back in June 2020, September 2015, and October 2011, all of which were bad times to be short the market.

Eventually, the herd is always slaughtered. A gang of bulls or a sleuth of bears, you should avoid being in either! When I think of the current buzzwords in the market, I think "soft landing" is a popular one. It is one that the majority of economists believe in, as per the National Association for Business Economics. Pay attention to the "soft landing" narrative carefully, I think it will turn out to be just as wrong as the early calls for "recession."

## Deceivers Galore

> All warfare is based on deception.

- Sun Tzu, The Art of War

Trading is not a team sport.

Your broker is not your friend, neither is Jim Cramer, and especially not some random guy on Twitter. In fact, assume that most everything you hear in finance is either incorrect or misleading in some way. Some might call this cynical, but when it comes to your money: trust should be earned, not granted. If we want to be hermetic about it: retrieve price quotes from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq, fundamental reports from the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) database, and news releases from PR Newswire. This might be too acetic for most, but it covers all your bases and minimizes incorrect information.

Every entity deserves some amount of skepticism, but many have blatant vested interests. Here is a short list of companies that deserve your scrutiny (AI assisted).

- Sell-Side Firms
  - Investment Banks: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup
  - Brokerage Firms: Merrill Lynch, Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, E*TRADE, Fidelity
  - Market Makers: Citadel Securities, Virtu Financial, Jane Street, Susquehanna International Group
- Sell-Side Finance Media
  - News Publications: Markets Media, TheDeal, Institutional Investor
  - Research Providers: Bloomberg Terminal, FactSet, S&P Global Market Intelligence, Morningstar, Moody's Analytics
  - Conferences & Events: SALT Hedge Fund Conference, Milken Institute Global Forum, CFA Institute Annual Conference, RiskMinds
- Other Financial Media Companies
  - Traditional: Bloomberg, Reuters, The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, Barron's
  - Cable News: CNBC, Fox Business, Bloomberg Television, CNN Business
  - Digital: MarketWatch, Seeking Alpha, The Motley Fool, Investopedia, Zacks Investment Research
  - Fintech Startups: The Information, Axios, Cheddar, Robinhood Snacks

Despite widespread skew, you will have to put your trust in *something*. Just make sure to do your homework before you fork over your money! For instance, I use Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch for quick looks, but I have found inaccuracies in their data so I check EDGAR before trading. I also use Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, and Vanguard to manage my accounts, but I have found my broker feeding me false spread data to shake me out of my trade. Why else would the bid on an option with an open interest of five update by the second? Why does it lower once I put in my ask? Why indeed.

Your portfolio manager wants you to "win" after they take their fee! Your broker wants you to "win" after they take their spread! Jim Cramer wants you to "win" after he uses your bid as exit liquidity! When it comes to markets, the mindset is "do for self." It may be arrogant, but it will save you money.

---

Not wanting to leave on too bleak of a tone, consider that by accepting the ugly truths of finance (a topic *much* deeper than probed here) you can more realistically approach the task at hand. Your task is to extract profit from the market, just like any other participant. If your preconceptions, or other's deceptions, are affecting your performance: step back, find the bias, and do your best to keep it check.

> The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.
