# The Doors of Perception

## Bias

There are myriad biases, do you believe you are unscathed?

The ugly truth is that we are all biased. To the investor, unchecked bias can be the difference between fortune, mediocrity, and ruin. Do you see things as they are or how you would like them to be? It is not a comfortable thing to realize that you are not so unique, you are not the exception to the rule, and your beliefs are typically false colorings of the real world.

What you believe and how you act in the world is important, but check it at the door when trading markets. The market does not care what your political and religious believes are. The market does not care if you are hungry or upset at the time. The market does not care if you "need the money." If anything, the market is doing its best to take your money! It is a zero sum game. When you lose, someone else wins. When you win, someone else loses.

Take a look at the following common biases and think about how they might relate to your decision making as an investor.

Information processing:

- Anchoring: Relying too much on the first information you get.
- Apophenia: Seeing patterns where there aren't any.
- Availability heuristic: Judging things based on what's easiest to remember.
- Bandwagon effect: Adopting beliefs or behaviors perceived as popular, regardless of personal opinion (Herd mentality).
- Confirmation bias: Paying attention to things that agree with what you already think.
- Framing effect: Making decisions based on how information is presented.
- Hindsight bias: Thinking you knew something was going to happen all along.

Self-awareness:

- Egocentric bias: Thinking the world revolves around you.
- False consensus effect: Overestimating how much others agree with you.
- Illusion of control: Believing you have more influence than you actually do.
- Overconfidence effect: Thinking you're better at things than you really are.
- Planning fallacy: Underestimating how long things will take.

Decision making:

- Escalation of commitment: Sticking with a bad decision because of time/money invested.
- Gambler's fallacy: Thinking past luck affects future events.
- Loss aversion: Hating to lose more than loving to win.
- Prospect theory: Making choices based on potential emotions, not just logic.
- Status quo bias: Preferring things to stay the same.

Others:

- Dunning-Kruger effect: Unskilled people overestimate their ability, experts underestimate.
- Impostor syndrome: Doubting your skills and fearing exposure as a fraud.

From the above, take note of which biases you may fall prey to. This is no easy task, because you have to be real with yourself! Perhaps you could ask another person to evaluate your biases if they know you well. In any case, we can learn these biases from the mistakes of others. Let us take a look at a few.

## Buffalo Jump

[BUFFALO JUMP HERE]

- Alfred Jacob Miller, *Hunting Buffalo*

Confirmation bias is rampant in markets. People see the world how they like to see it. The bandwagon effect is also rampant. People like being part of the crowd. Within markets, participants develop theories on the state of the economy and where it is headed. Some of these theories become quite popular. Think about all the groveling we have heard for the past year and a half over whether or not we are going to have a recession! All the while, the market moved not based on what they believed but based on what they did.

[GRAPH HERE]

The graph above shows the S&P 500 E-mini futures (ES1!) and its associated positioning data on the bottom. I like to balance my positioning indicator as follows:

$$
{\text{Manager Longs} \over \text{Manager Shorts}}
\times
{\text{Dealer Shorts} \over \text{Dealer Longs}}
$$

To laymen, asset managers may be seen as sophisticated market participants. The ugly truth is that they are often just as biased as their clients. We can call them "dumb money" for our purposes. Dealers and commercials are called "smart money" because they typically use automated processes for their decision making. They are not *always* on the right side of a trade, but they are more frequently on the right side of a trade.

The bandwagon effect is, in part, driven by confirmation bias. As the bear thesis played out and seemed accurate, more people shorted the market. A few people short the market, make a profit, and then everybody wants to do the same. The ES1! index declined -24.5% from December 2021 to October 2022. During the same period, our positioning indicator declined by -93.8%! Being bearish was very popular. This is similar to bearish positioning back in June 2020, September 2015, and October 2011, all of which were bad times to be short the market.

When I think of the current buzzwords in the market, I think "soft landing" is a big one. It is one that most people believe in by now as per the National Association for Business Economics.
