# Getting Things Started

> Well begun is half done.

My name is Dilettante.

I have been learning financial markets for the past year and a half. I'm starting this blog to share how to think about trading and investing.

I intend to target a cross-sectional audience of market participants with content that both amateurs and professionals can enjoy. My goal is to provide simple content that is fundamental, not prosaic, and complex content that is enigmatic, not incomprehensible. I will also discuss current trends in markets.

In time, I aim to establish a consistent publishing schedule and tailor the content to the evolving niche of the blog.

Welcome to the journey.
