## Is Simplicity Best?

Last week, we discussed how to calculate the closed-form equation for a simple linear model. This will allow us to look at the relationship between two variables, like time and price, but only in the most simple fashion.

How should we fit a regression model if our system is more complex?

To start, let’s take a look at the output of a simple linear regression model where the independent variable is time and the dependent variable is the log of the price of the S&P 500 cash index (SPX). We are claiming that time is causing price to act a certain way and not the other way around.
