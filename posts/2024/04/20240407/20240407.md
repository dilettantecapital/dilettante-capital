# Signal to Noise

> Wheat from chaff.

In today's article, we learn about a way to standardize returns by volatility and examine our current situation.

## Preamble

This article will be sort of "mathy." If that's not your cup of tea, skip to read the conclusion in the last section!

## Mean

A mean is a measure of central tendency.

Most people are familiar with the "arithmetic mean" or the sum of a set of numbers divided by the size of the set. This is also what most people mean when they say "average."

## Standard Deviation

A standard deviation (SD) is a measure of dispersion, specifically around the mean.

To calculate a SD, the math is a little more involved. First, you take the difference between each number in a set and the mean of the set. These are called deviations. With these deviations, square each one and then sum them all together. Divide the summed squared deviations by the size of the set and now we have the variance. The square root of the variance is the SD.

You can think of a SD as a measured "step" out from the mean. Given one "step" in either direction about the mean (plus or minus one SD), we can assert that 68% of the data in a normal distribution can be found within this range. Two steps and now we can find 95% of the data. Three steps and 99.7% of the data is there. Technically, this goes on forever.

## Coefficient of Variation

The coefficient of variation (CV) is the SD divided by the mean.

This makes the SD relative to the magnitude of your original data. For example, if we have a mean of 10 and a SD of 5, our CV would be 0.5. Now imagine if we had a mean of 100 and a SD of 50, our CV would remain at 0.5.

## Signal to Noise Ratio

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the inverse of the CV.

This makes the mean relative to the magnitude of your original data. Using the examples above, if we have a mean of 10 and a SD 5, the SNR is 2. Same if we have a mean of 100 and a SD of 50.

## This Juice is Too Sweet

Cherry-picking the length, there was a 100 trading-day rally between October 2023 and March 2024 that saw +27.1% gains in the S&P 500 cash index (SPX). This rally had very low variance, meaning that it was basically a straight line up. If we calculate the SNR for the daily returns during this rally, it comes in at 40.4.

The condition of a rally this length with an SNR of 40.4 or more is quite rare! It happened in January 2018 and shortly after there was a -11.7% correction within 9 days. It happened in May 1995 and while there were no large corrections, the ride up got a whole lot bumpier. It happened in April 1971 and there was a 51 day correction of -5.5%. Lastly, it happened in April 1964 and there was a -2.3% correction over 32 days. Do note all these lengths above are trading days, not calendar days.

Given the history above, we should expect a lower SNR in the near term. Certainly more volatility and likely some sort of correction.
