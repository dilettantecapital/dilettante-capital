## March in Review

The rally continued through March, the Ides ignored. For American equities, the Russell 2000 led with a +3.39% gain, the S&P 500 by +3.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average by +2.08%, and the Nasdaq Composite lagged the pack but was still in the green with +1.79%. Globally, Spain jumped to the top with a +10.73% gain, Germany surged by 4.61%, Britain rose by 4.23% (highlighted last month), and similarly the Euro Stoxx 50 gained +4.22%. In Asian markets, Japan continued its rally on the Nikkei 225 with +3.07%, but China was more reserved with the SSE Composite ticking +0.86% higher.

The U.S. 10-year government bond rate declined by -0.046 points to a rate of 4.206%. The Federal Funds rate was held constant for the seventh month in a row. The VIX was squished even further, shrinking by -0.39 points.

As a potential sign of re-igniting inflation, the Goldman Sachs Commodities Index rose by +4.40%, which we called wrong last month. Gold had a stellar month, increasing by +9.27%. Silver outshone its big brother, gaining +10.21%. Bitcoin gained plenty, but a lot less than February, ticking up by +14.06%. We presumed Bitcoin would recapture its ATH and it did so; the new high comes in at $73,794.

## Equity Flows

Flows were more mixed than the sea of green seen in February. NVDA is still the most active stock, pushing higher by +13.83% on $1.098T of flows.

Using this heatmap made me skeptical this month, notice how it says CEG pushed up by +36.93%? When you take a look at the stock, it did well in March, but the gain was only +9.95%. I'll have to look for more reliable data in the future.

## NVDA Inflection?

In the same vein as yesterday's weekly article, let's draw a potential ceiling trendline for NVDA:

Once again, it should be noted that that there is nothing magical about this line, it can be broken. However, as long as the market notices and respects this line, it's important. This seems to be the case judging by last month's price action.

The line highlighted $984 as a possible high for March and the actual high was $974, from which we've deflated back down to $903. Crucially, the big number of $1000 is fair game for next month! Watch this level.
