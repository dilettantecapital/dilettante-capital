## Missing the Forest for the Trees

When I started this blog, my mind was racing with ideas of what to write about. Looking back, I should have had a notebook to fill with those early ideas. Now, when I think about what to write for the week, my mind splits into different topics or themes.

Should I write about the current technical evaluation of the market? Should I break down a quantitative method in simple terms? Should I take a broader approach and relate finance to the rest of life?

Simultaneously, it's as if I have much to say and also nothing at all. None of my ideas seem as revelatory or potent as they once did. None of my efforts to provide a foothold for newbies into the labyrinthine world of finance have panned out as I imagined they would.

## Reboot

I have nothing for you this week. Hopefully, that changes by the next one!
