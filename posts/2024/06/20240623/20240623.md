# Calling the Top

> We're in for a bumpy ride.

In this week's article, we review evidence that, for now, the best juice has been squeezed.

Attempting to call market tops is a silly thing to do. Yet here I am, thinking that we are close.

## Decomposing Sentiment

Last week, we peeked at market sentiment. For reference, here it is again:

We do not have to highlight the current sentiment level on the S&P 500 cash index (SPX) because the reading today is the highest in the series.

Today, we will take a closer look to understand what this indicator is telling us. To start, let us extract the futures positioning portion of the indicator.

...

Pitting dumb money against smart money, we find that S&P 500 E-mini futures (ES1!) positioning is the most bullish it has been since May 2008. Before that, only January 2008 and October 2006 saw such extended bullish positioning.

It is worth noting that between October 2006 and October 2007, ES1! prices would push higher by about +15%. In retrospect, this small reward pales in comparison to the market risk soon to follow. If you had exited in October 2006, you would have been spared the -50% decline into March 2009. Of course, these numbers are cherry-picked. However, the main takeaway is that it took the market until July 2012 to finally leave behind the levels seen in October 2006 for good.

Next, we will look at options volatility.

...

Taking the ratio between bullish options volatility and overall volatility, we find that our current scenario is as muted (bullish) as October 2017, June 2014, and December 2006. We have already discussed what it would mean to exit the market in late 2006, but let us simulate an exit point for the other two periods.

If you were to stay out of the market from October 2017 onward, you could have missed a +32% upside potential if you were to sell in January 2020, but this would quickly reverse to -6.6% by March 2020. Between 2018 and 2020, the market saw a lot of "see-saw" action, which can make investors uncomfortable. The fact is, you could have skipped some volatility and entered at a lower level in the future if you chose to stay out.

For the June 2014 scenario, it is a similar lesson. You could have entered at a level that is -5.4% below the original later in February 2016. These unrealized losses are not huge discounts like 2009, but they are periods of lost time for flat returns. We would be better off being invested in risk-free assets during periods like these.

Finally, we examine a spread between assets under management (AUM) allocated to leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

...

Another story of bulls versus bears. We have not seen bulls putting their money where their mouth is in the same magnitude since the feverish December 2021 and a more restrained January 2018. We discussed a hypothetical exit in late 2017, like an exit in early 2018, with the main difference being that a January 2018 exit would have kept us more comfortable along the journey to March 2020.

As for December 2021, it would have been hard to imagine such a bullish AUM allocation given the history of the series. Regardless, if we were to time it well, an exit in late 2021 could have prevented a -24.6% loss into October 2022. Again, that timing is too perfect, but if we were to look at avoiding the market around that time in another light, we could have missed none of the action between April 2021 and October 2023.

That was a lot already, but we have more work to do.
