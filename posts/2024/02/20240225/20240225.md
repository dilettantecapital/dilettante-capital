# Know Thyself

> The market isn't your biggest obstacle, it's yourself.

In today's article, we examine how investigating your habits, preferences, and reactions can affect your performance in the market.

## Delphic Maxims

Three maxims attributed to the Seven Sages were known to be inscribed at the entrance to the Temple of Apollo since at least the 5th century BC. Their English translations are as follows:

- Know thyself
- Nothing too much
- Give a pledge and trouble is at hand

In this article, we will focus on the first and arguably most important of the maxims.

## Who Are You?

In a previous article, we discussed [cognitive biases and sources of disinformation](https://dilettantecapital.com/p/reality-check) relating to the markets. Now, we will turn our attention to our own abilities and their limits.

## Limitation

Understanding your limits, ironically, can be a freeing experience.

I believe that one of the most important problems of our time is information overload. At no other point in human history have we had such a wealth of interconnected information. Our cultures are increasingly interconnected as well. In a world where you can learn anything, work towards any career, move to any country, what do you do? Unfortunately, the array of choices is leaving many people feeling stress, anxiety, and decision fatigue.

The trick of course, is that you *cannot* do all of these things. If you only have one hour a day for your hobbies, you will have to choose what you want to do that particular day. One day spent knitting is gone forever. It will not come back so you can try crochet instead. You can try crochet tomorrow, but then that day will be gone forever.

This applies to opportunities in the market. In 2022, you could have bought META at a P/E of 8, a wonderful opportunity. That ship has sailed. Instead of groaning over the waves you failed to catch, why not look at the waves headed your way?

## Potential

A four year old with a lot of potential is natural, a forty year old with a lot of potential is pitiful.

Potential is an energy that you expend to form something concrete. Time is potential. Talent is potential. Good health is potential. If you are young, gifted, and healthy, you should be doing everything you can to channel your potential into something solid. Whether that is a saga of experiences, a set of skills, a disciplined body, a curious mind, or a calm soul, you should be searching for something to feed yourself into.

Eventually, you must direct your potential. This is called discipline. Discipline does not mean you are holding yourself back. In fact, it means that you are consciously choosing to pursue the "next level." Getting proper sleep every night is a prerequisite for optimal mental activity. Eating a healthy diet is a prerequisite for optimal physical health. Consistent practice is a prerequisite for mastery of any skill.

To understand where you are going, you have to understand where you have been and now are.

## Assessment

If we would like to know where we "fit in," we have plenty of tools at our disposal.

An intelligence quotient (IQ) is a score that attempts to assess human intelligence. Much has been written for and against such a measure, but the fact remains that "general intelligence" is one of the most robust psychometrics that exists. It should be thought of as a potential, not a predestination. For example, there are intelligent people that get bad grades in school. There are many people that get better grades, not because they are smarter but because they are more determined. You can take [a free IQ test here](https://test.mensa.no/Home/Test/en-US).

The Personality Assessment System (PAS) was developed by John W. Gittinger after he noticed personality type similarities within subtest results of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) assessment. Gittinger believed that personality was the product of both genetics (intellectual preferences) and environment (compensation for instincts). Be careful when interpreting the results of these tests, some of the terminology is considered outdated. You can take [the PAS Primitive and Basic tests here](https://www.pasf.org/pasq/index.htm).

Finally, Ray Dalio's experience leading his investment management firm Bridgewater Associates led him to develop a test for his workers. This assessment attempts to describe how you prefer to think, engage with others, and apply yourself. If you feel friction with your role in an organization, try this test out!
