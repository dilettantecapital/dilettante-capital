## Magnificent Seven

The so-called Magnificent Seven (Mag 7) stocks have garnered significant attention in financial media over the past year. These stocks, listed by size, include Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA), collectively approaching a total capitalization of $13 trillion. These seven are among the top ten largest stocks, accounting for 29% of the S&P 500's total capitalization. Notably, during the Dotcom bubble, the ten largest stocks represented a concentration of 33%, an analog worth considering.

Net insider flows for the Magnificent Seven in billions of dollars.

Between March 2023 and the end of January 2024, slightly over a billion dollars were withdrawn from these stocks. February marked a notable acceleration in the rate of selling, with over $9 billion in sales recorded in the past month alone. Clearly, insiders are thinking this is a good time to take profits.

## Conclusions

The Mag 7 are called the "generals" due to their historical tendency to lead the market into bear and bull phases in recent years. When the insiders of these companies collectively sell in bulk, showing little confidence for the future performance of their stocks at this valuation, shouldn't we consider taking some risk off of the table as well?
