# The Game of Investing

This post marks the beginning of a series of weekly educational articles. The topics covered may range from general advice to specific technical knowledge. I hope you find them useful.

## Investing is Security

Why invest at all? After the recent wave of inflation, the answer should be clear.

The Federal Reserve maintains a long-run inflation target of 2%. What does that mean for you? If your money is in the bank, its original value is cut in half every 35 years. From 1944 to the present, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported an average inflation rate of 3.71% - not just a target, a measured reality. This implies that your money's purchasing power is halved every 19 years.

Digging deeper, analysts like John Williams suggest recent inflation rates are underestimated by a factor of two. Assuming this holds true, we can consider an inflation rate of 5.04% since 2002. In this scenario, the value of your money is halved every 14 years.

Whether it takes 35 years or 14 years for your money to lose half of its value, the strength of your buying power should concern you. After all, why put in the hard work if you cannot safeguard its fruits?

## Investing is a Game

One way to think about investing is as a game of this for that.

Imagine you want to buy a medium-sized cup of black coffee from Starbucks. This would cost you $1.55 in 2001 and $2.45 in 2020. Notice that the simple act of buying coffee can be thought of as a pair trade. I receive one cup of coffee if I provide two and a half dollars. If we invert the trade, we can better understand the pair. One dollar cost 0.645 cups of coffee in 2001 and 0.408 cups of coffee in 2020. To put it another way, the value of coffee has outperformed the value of the dollar by +58% in this period.

What does this have to do with investing?

Instead of storing our wealth in dollars, we can own something that will be more desirable in the future. Take the S&P 500 index as an example. This index measures the summed market capitalization of the 500 largest U.S. companies. You could have purchased one contract of the S&P 500 cash index for $1158.76 in 2001 and for $3236.05 in 2020. We can invert the trade once again to better understand the pair. A thousand dollars cost 0.863 contracts in 2001 and 0.309 contracts in 2020. As a percent change, the value of the S&P 500 market index outperformed the value of a dollar by +179% during this period.

Notice that by being invested in the market from 2001 to 2020, we could have had 2.79x more dollars than if we simply saved them. With an inflation rate of 3.71%, the purchasing power of the dollar would be halved over the same period, so we can equate this to a 1.4x increase in general purchasing power by being invested. Lastly, our Starbucks example indicates a 1.77x increase in the number of cups of coffee because of the investment.

## Investors Seek Superior Assets

Whether we are talking about dollars, general buying power, or Starbucks coffee, being invested in U.S. equity markets from 2001 to 2020 increased our purchasing power for all the “assets” above. Purchasing power cannot be owned directly, so it is not really an asset, but it is a useful benchmark for investment goals. I would like to point out that equities are not the only worthwhile asset to own. For instance, if you were to own barrels of crude oil during the same period, you could have outperformed the S&P 500 depending on your timing.

In a pool of assets, investors want to hold the one that will outperform all the others in the future. The trick is knowing which asset that is.
