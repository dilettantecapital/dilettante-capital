# Money Is Not Everything

```txt
Big houses, nice cars, all that stuff cool
But it's materialistic things that we strive so hard for
As human beings, and it's not fulfillin'
It doesn't take away the pain, it doesn't take away the loss
You have to search higher, you have to go higher for that
The higher power, that higher energy
And that's what I'm striving for
So in the event that I go and you have to bury me
You can bury me with all these things
And as soon as I see my Maker, I would give it all back
I'd give it all away because it wasn't nowhere near as important
As being in Heaven and bein' at peace
