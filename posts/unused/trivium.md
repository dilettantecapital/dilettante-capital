# Trivium

The Classical Model of education, often associated with classical or liberal arts education, includes the Trivium as one of its foundational components. The Trivium is a set of three core subjects that were considered essential for a well-rounded education in classical antiquity. The three stages of the Trivium are:

- Grammar:
  - Focus: The study of language and its structure.
  - Objective: Acquisition of the fundamentals of a subject, including vocabulary, rules, and basic facts.
  - Developmental Stage: The early years of education, where students build a solid foundation in language, understanding the structure, and rules of grammar.
- Logic (or Dialectic):
  - Focus: The study of reasoning and critical thinking.
  - Objective: Development of analytical and reasoning skills, enabling students to think logically, make arguments, and evaluate information.
  - Developmental Stage: Middle school and early high school years, where students learn to apply logical reasoning and engage in discussions and debates.
- Rhetoric:
  - Focus: The art of effective communication.
  - Objective: Mastery of persuasive expression, both in speaking and writing.
  - Developmental Stage: Later high school and college years, where students refine their communication skills, learn to articulate ideas persuasively, and become effective communicators.

The Trivium was traditionally seen as the foundation of a classical education, providing students with the tools necessary for clear thinking, effective communication, and a deep understanding of various subjects. It emphasizes the development of intellectual skills that are applicable across disciplines and essential for lifelong learning.
